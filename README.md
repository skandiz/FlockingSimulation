# Flocking Simulation &amp; Analysis
Flocking figures as part of a class of mesoscopic phenomena which show emergent patterns.
The movement behaviour is essentially a modified Craig Reynolds model and consists in the following mechanisms:
  - Social Interactions
  - Wall Interaction
  - Control Interactions

The simulation is performed with Processing a graphic library and IDE based on Java.

The analysis is performed with Python and (for now) it's only a Global Analysis, a clustering technique will be implemented to compute local observables.
