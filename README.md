# Flocking Simulation &amp; Analysis
Flocking figures as part of a class of mesoscopic phenomena which show emergent patterns.
The movement behaviour is essentially a modified Craig Reynolds model and consists in the following mechanisms:
* [Social Interactions](#Social-Interactions)
* [Wall Interaction](#Wall-Interaction)
* [Control Interactions](#Control-Interactions)

The simulation is performed with Processing a graphic library and IDE based on Java.

The analysis is performed with Python and is divided in the following codes:

* [Global Analysiss](#Global-Analysis)
* [Clustering technique with a code to create a video of the clustering result](#clustering)
* [Local Analysis](#Local-Analysis)
